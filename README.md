## Welcome my learning track

##  we learn how to make arepo and how to use Git which is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

 ## inorder to  interact with remote repositories, you need to use remote repositories to push information to and pull data from.


# By running the git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.

# By using git remote -v, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.

  # example: $ git remote -v
